    <h2>About</h2>
		<center>
		<p class = "text">
			cARe-19 is a non-profit organization that works to help people and hospitals in need; whether it be emotionally or of money and supplies during this pandemic. We send PPE to workers on front line that critically need this vital equipment, send money to hospitals that need renovation and more ICU units, funds groups developing vaccines, finding a cure for the virus, and organizations that help people affected by the virus with the donations we get.
      <br>
      With the use of echoAR's AR platform we're able to help people in the hospital (or just bored because of quarantine and social distancing) and people that are affected by the virus be able to go to places or see things they didn't think they could see/view with echoAR. We're able to allow people to stay entertained and engaged in the safety of their home, and keep people sane and mental health good!
